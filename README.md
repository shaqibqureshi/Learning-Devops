# DevOps Learning Journey

This repository is where I document my learning journey in DevOps. I am currently focusing on understanding the fundamentals such as Linux, networking, docker, kubernetes, and other core concepts required for DevOps roles. I practice concepts on the terminal first and then write notes here in my own words.

I am using this repository to track my progress and stay consistent with my learning. As I continue learning and improving my skills, I will start adding hands on projects and more structured content over time.
