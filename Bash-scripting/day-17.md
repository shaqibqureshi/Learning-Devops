# Bash Functions 

# What I Learned Today

Today I learned about Functions in Bash scripting

A function is a reusable block of code that helps avoid repetition and makes scripts clean and organized.

I learned:

- How to define a function
- How to call a function
- How to pass arguments (`$1`, `$2`)
- How return status works (`return` and `$?`)
- Using variables inside functions
- Using `local` variables
- Calling one function inside another
- Why functions are important in real projects



# Function Syntax

```bash
my_function() {
    commands
}
